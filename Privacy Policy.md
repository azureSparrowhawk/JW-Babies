            Data we collect
            • Personal data: We do not collect, store, or transmit personal information.
            • On-device settings: The app stores basic settings on your device (for example, UI preferences). We cannot access these settings.
            • Usage/analytics: We do not use analytics, advertising, or crash-reporting services.
            • Cookies and similar technologies: We do not use cookies or similar tracking technologies.
            • Children’s data: JW Babies is suitable for children, including those under 13. We do not collect personal information from children.

            How data is processed
            • On-device only: All app features (including word lists and settings) operate on your device. No user data is sent to our servers.
            • No selling or sharing: We do not sell, rent, or share personal information.

            Third-party software
            • The app may include third-party/open-source components (for example, UI or animation libraries). These components are used locally within the app and do not collect personal information. See the Licenses section in Settings for details.

            Security
            • Because we do not collect or store personal data on our servers, our exposure is limited. We rely on the security features of iOS/iPadOS. No method of software operation is 100% secure.

            Children’s privacy
            • JW Babies is designed for families and children. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided personal information to us, please contact us and we will address it promptly.

            International transfers
            • We do not transfer personal data internationally because we do not collect it.

            Your rights

            Changes to this policy
